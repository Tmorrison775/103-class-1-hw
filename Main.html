    <h1><em><strong>What are slivers?</strong></em></h1>
    <p class=p>Slivers are a creature type in Magic The Gathering(MTG), a popular trading card game. Slivers are a variant of creature that morphs and evolves constantly and rapidly even within minutes to respond to their environment. They live in hives much like bees and have a hivemind which is the "queen/king" of the hive. Slivers exist to expand their hive, and if you are not helping the slivers expand and grow, then you are treated as an enemy and attacked. They vary in size from being the size of a small dog, to the size of a schoolbus.  </p>
